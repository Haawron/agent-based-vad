# Perception Models: An Easy to Use Repository for Perception Tasks

**[Meta AI Research, FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/research)**

---
Perception Models is a user-friendly repository designed to support the training, inference, and evaluation of Perception Language Model (PLM) and Perception Encoder (PE). It is designed to be modular and easy to expand and experiment with.

---

* **[Apr-17-25]:** Perception Encoder (PE) and Perception Language Model (PLM) are released. [[`Blog`](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-fair-updates-perception-localization-reasoning)] :fire::fire:

## Perception Encoder (PE)

[![Hugging Face Collection](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Collection-blue)](https://huggingface.co/collections/facebook/perception-encoder-67f977c9a65ca5895a7f6ba1) [![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technical%20Report-Perception%20Encoder-b31b1b.svg)](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/perception-encoder-the-best-visual-embeddings-are-not-at-the-output-of-the-network)
[![Model License](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model_License-Apache_2.0-olive)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

We release PE - a family of state-of-the-art vision encoders for vision-centric
and vision-language tasks. We refer the readers to [`apps/pe/README.md`](apps/pe/README.md) where we provide details about inference, evaluation and downstream tasks.

[![Model License](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model_License-FAIR_Research_License-lightgrey)](LICENSE.PLM)

We release PLM - a family of open and fully reproducible models to facilitate research in vision-language model (VLM). We refer the readers to [`apps/plm/README.md`](apps/plm/README.md) where we provide details about training, evaluation and inference using PLM.

## Installation :wrench:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/perception_models.git
cd perception_models

conda create --name perception_models python=3.12
conda activate perception_models

# Install PyTorch
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

# We use torchcodec for decoding videos into PyTorch tensors
conda install ffmpeg -c conda-forge
pip install torchcodec==0.1 --index-url=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

pip install -e .
```
This will install an editable version of repo, allowing you to make changes to the code without needing to reinstall the package every time.
